# Introduction-to-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow-in-Cloud

Computer Vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. This involves developing algorithms and models that can extract meaningful information from images, videos, and other types of visual data. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that is widely used in the development of computer vision applications. It provides a powerful set of tools for building, training, and deploying machine learning models on a variety of hardware platforms, including cloud-based environments.
Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular platform for developing and deploying computer vision applications, due to its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. Cloud-based environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), provide access to powerful computing resources and a wide range of machine learning tools and services. This makes it easier for developers to build and deploy computer vision applications without having to worry about managing their own hardware and infrastructure. TensorFlow provides a range of tools and libraries that are specifically designed for building computer vision applications. These include pre-trained models, such as the popular Inception and MobileNet models, as well as tools for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. TensorFlow also provides tools for data augmentation and preprocessing, which can help improve the accuracy and robustness of computer vision models.
